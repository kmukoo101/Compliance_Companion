## üõ°Ô∏è CVEye Compliance Companion

This is an open-source, GUI-based cybersecurity compliance checker for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Built for SMBs, IT admins, and privacy-conscious users, it scans for basic security controls, checks custom hardening rules, and generates actionable reports mapped to frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, and HIPAA.

Most free compliance tools are overly complex, CLI-only, or locked behind subscriptions. CVEye is free, readable, modifiable, and gets the job done with clarity.
